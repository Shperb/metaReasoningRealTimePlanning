# Project Name

## Welcome to <Project Name> project!
The purpose of the project is to... 

## Prerequisites
We use `clang` ecosystem to compile and develop the codebase. You can install necessary components by running
```
sudo apt install clang-6.0 clang-tidy-6.0 clang-format-6.0
```

Install up-to-date CMake version. We also use `cmake-format` to keep our CMake files tidy.
```
sudo pip install cmake
sudo pip install cmake-format
```

### Conan Setup

The [Conan](https://conan.io) package manager is used to manage project's external
dependencies. This section describes the process of setting it up.  Installation is as simple as running

```
sudo pip3 install conan
```

#### Creating Profiles
We need to setup a Conan profile — a list of properties that characterize the
environment.  The following commands will create a new profile called `default` and set it up
for Ubuntu 16.04 environment.  If you are using several profiles, you may want to choose a
more descriptive name for it.
```
# create new profile called 'default'
conan profile new default --detect
# modify settings of the 'default' profile
conan profile update settings.compiler.version=5.4 default
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```
At the moment, there exist precompiled versions of the packages needed by
the project for this particular profile:

```
os=Linux
arch=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.version=5.4
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
build_type=Release
```

Note that you can have multiple profiles and also modify existing ones when needed.
For more details see the Conan [Getting Started](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) guide.
